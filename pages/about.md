I'm Rahul Jugnarain. I love technology, innovation and strategy. The harder the problem, the more excited I am to try solve it.

I currently work at [Publicis Sapient](https://www.publicissapient.com/) in London, where we help large business transform digitally.

Aside from that, I have a ton of interests that I hope to write about on this blog. 

These include:
* Start-ups/Disruptive Innovation
* Crypto/Decentralised Finance
* Coding (currently learning/using Python & MQL)
