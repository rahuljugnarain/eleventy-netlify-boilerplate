## Hey there! I'm Rahul Jugnarain.

Welcome to my personal blog, where I hope to write about things I'm passionate / curious about. This may include whatever I'm learning about, but one thing you'll hopefully soon find here in abundance is "Product" related items. Currently a Junior Associate Product Manager, my mission is to explore, understand, test, and build meaningful solutions for real people. [More about me](/about/)

I decided to go live with this website in it's bare state. Why? because I believe it's easier to incrementally work towards something that's already live, rather than slowly polishing it until it's perfect and full of content. I've set up a Kanban on Notion where you can keep track of what I've completed so far, what's in progress, and what I plan to do soon enough. [Click here for the Kanban Board](https://jugnarain.notion.site/11159de418774f108030e41df07b6574?v=bbf77e0017194aea934e1a486a063515)
