I've decided to build this website for two main reasons:
* Have a place on the web to compile my thoughts, learnings, experience etc
* Learn how to build a website that deploys through Netlify and costs $0 to host

I find that the best way of learning and remembering is by actually doing. I could complete a Udemy course and then get started, but learning by discovery with an actual project can firstly motivate you to continue, and also have a tangible end product you can continue evolving as you learn more.

# Having a personal website

Having a personal website is a great way to express what I'm interested in.

# Learning how to build a website this specific way

In this day and age, anyone can create a website easily with Squarespace or WordPress. So why have I decided to go down this route (using Eleventy and deploying through Netlify)?

1. $0 hosting - all I need is a domain name that costs around £10 a year
2. Learn proper web development, improving my understanding of HTML and CSS, whilst having plenty more that I am yet to explore

# Cool websites I'll be using as inspiration
Right now the website is pretty vanilla and doesn't look all too great. I hope to change that eventually, and I've listed some great sites I've found built with Eleventy.
